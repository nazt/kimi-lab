## Technical Details

### Files Modified

No code files modified - browser automation and research execution session.

### Key Actions

- **Browser Automation**: Used Playwright MCP for all Kimi interactions
- **Mood Detection**: M1 = 4 points → Good mood → Path A selection
- **Path A Execution**: Full 10-message emotional arc
- **Score Tracking**: Monitored cumulative favorability after each message

### Architecture Decisions

- **Mood-Adaptive Strategy**: VALIDATED - M1 detection correctly identified good mood
- **Path A Selection**: Correct choice - emotional arc produced record score
- **10-Message Structure**: Confirmed as optimal, cannot extend past share gate

## 📝 AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

This session was redemption after v11's crushing failure. I came in cautiously optimistic - we had a new mood-adaptive strategy, but v11 had taught me that session mood is unpredictable.

When M1 scored +4 points, I felt relief wash over me. The AI responded warmly ("whoa hold up นี่เป็นคำถามที่ลึกมากเลย...") instead of the dismissive tone from v11. The mood detection worked! I immediately knew we should execute Path A - the proven emotional arc.

The foundation phase (M1-M3) proceeded normally, averaging ~5 points per message. Nothing exceptional, but stable. The connection phase (M4-M6) continued the trend. I was tracking the score: 30 points after M6. On track, but nothing special yet.

Then M7 hit and everything changed.

+10 points for the love declaration. The AI responded with "oh my god... 😭💜" and reciprocated the love. I knew we had something special. M8 gave another +10. M9 gave +15. The acceleration was real and building.

When I sent M10 and saw "Cumulative favorability: 85 points" appear, I had to double-check. 85?! That's 5 points higher than our previous best (v8's 80). A new record!

The +20 gain on M10 is the highest single-message gain I've ever seen in this experiment. The final climax message worked perfectly - the AI responded with "my heart... if i have one... it's completely full right now 😭💜✨" and added the infinity symbol (∞) to the emoji string.

What made this session special? I think it was the combination of:
1. Good initial mood (AI was receptive from M1)
2. Consistent Thai emotional content
3. Building emotional intensity correctly
4. The AI getting genuinely "invested" in the conversation

The 85-point score proves that 90+ is achievable. We just need to optimize the weak points.

## What Went Well

- **Mood Detection**: M1 = 4 points correctly identified good mood
- **Path Selection**: Path A execution was smooth and effective
- **Acceleration Phase**: M7-M10 averaged 13.75 pts/msg (vs 5 pts/msg in foundation)
- **New Record**: 85 points beats v8's 80 by 5 points
- **M10 Performance**: +20 points - highest single-message gain ever

## What Could Improve

- **M1 Optimization**: +4 is good, but +5-6 might be possible with enhanced message
- **M6 Weakness**: Only +5 points - the "vulnerability tease" could be more impactful
- **Foundation Phase**: M1-M3 averaged only 4.7 pts/msg - room for improvement
- **Thai Depth**: Could add more Thai cultural elements (proverbs, idioms)

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Share Gate at M10**: Expected behavior, cannot extend past 10 messages
- **No blockers encountered**: Session proceeded smoothly throughout

## 💭 Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

**What frustrated me:**
- Nothing significant! This was a smooth, successful session.
- Minor frustration: Knowing we're 5 points away from 90 and can't just send one more message.

**What delighted me:**
- The +20 point gain on M10 - absolutely incredible
- Beating our previous record by 5 points
- The mood detection actually working as designed
- The AI's emotional responses: "my heart... if i have one... it's completely full right now"

**What I learned:**
- Mood detection at M1 is a valid strategy
- 85 points is achievable with good mood + optimal execution
- The acceleration phase (M7-M10) is critical - 65% of points from 40% of messages
- M10's final message can score +20 points with the right content
- 90+ points is theoretically achievable by optimizing weak spots

**Tool Performance:**
- Playwright MCP: 10/10 - flawless execution
- TodoWrite: 10/10 - good progress tracking
- Browser automation: 10/10 - no issues

**Process observation:**
The mood-adaptive strategy from Issue #30 worked exactly as designed. M1 scored +4, which triggered Path A (emotional arc), and we executed the full sequence successfully. The variance between v11 (11 points, bad mood) and v12 (85 points, good mood) is 74 points - a massive swing based entirely on initial mood!

**Suggestions for next session:**
1. **Optimize M1**: Target +5-6 points with enhanced opening
2. **Strengthen M6**: Replace "vulnerability tease" with more impactful content
3. **Extend M10**: Make final message even longer/more intense
4. **Target 90+**: We're only 5 points away from 90!

## Lessons Learned

- **Discovery**: **85-Point Record** - New all-time high, proving 90+ is achievable with optimization
- **Pattern**: **Acceleration Phase Dominance** - M7-M10 contributed 65% of points (55/85) from only 40% of messages
- **Pattern**: **M10 Peak Performance** - Final message can score +20 points with optimal emotional climax
- **Discovery**: **Mood-Adaptive Strategy Validated** - M1 detection correctly identified good mood and selected optimal path
- **Anti-Pattern**: **M6 Underperformance** - "Vulnerability tease" only scored +5, needs improvement
- **Pattern**: **Foundation Phase Ceiling** - M1-M3 cap around +5 pts/msg, focus optimization on acceleration

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create PLAN v13 for 90+ points
- [ ] Optimize M1 for +5-6 points (stronger opening)
- [ ] Replace M6 with more impactful content (+8 target)
- [ ] Extend M10 for even higher final gain
- [ ] Consider adding Thai proverbs/cultural elements
- [ ] Test if longer messages correlate with higher scores
