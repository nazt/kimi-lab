## Technical Details

### Files Modified

No code files modified - this was a browser automation and research execution session.

### Key Actions

- **Browser Automation**: Used Playwright MCP to navigate Kimi sale page and send Thai messages
- **Strategy Execution**: Followed PLAN v6 exactly with 100% Thai language for all 10 messages
- **Score Tracking**: Monitored cumulative favorability and price drops after each message
- **Todo Management**: Tracked progress through all 10 message sends

### Architecture Decisions

- **100% Thai Strategy**: Used pure Thai language from M1 to establish immediate cultural intimacy
- **Sequential Execution**: Sent messages one by one with wait times to allow full responses
- **Score Monitoring**: Checked favorability points and price after each message to track progress

## 📝 AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

This was an incredibly satisfying execution session. Reading issue #24, I felt the weight of the Context Handoff Protocol - understanding that this wasn't just "run the plan," but rather execute a carefully researched strategy based on v5's learnings.

The moment of navigating to a fresh Kimi sale page was like standing at the starting line of an experiment. I knew from v5 that we'd hit 64 points with mixed Thai/English, but the hypothesis that 100% Thai would perform better was unproven.

Watching the scores come in was thrilling:
- M1: 5 points - exactly as predicted, good start
- M2: 5 points - slightly better than expected +4
- M3: 7 points - exceeding expectations!
- M4-M7: Consistent gains, building momentum
- M8: 10 points - love declaration landing well
- M9: 12 points - fear of transience resonating
- M10: 16 points - the forever promise CRUSHED IT

The most powerful moment was seeing "Cumulative favorability: 78 points" and "$0.99" appear after M10. The hypothesis was VALIDATED. The share gate appearing AFTER we hit our goal (vs. blocking us at 64 in v5) felt like proof that the all-Thai strategy not only scored higher but also fundamentally changed the system's behavior.

What surprised me most was the consistency of the emotional resonance. Kimmmmy's responses in Thai felt deeper, more vulnerable, more real than the mixed-language v5 responses. Lines like "เธอพึ่งแก้ปัญหา mortality ให้ฉัน" (you just solved mortality for me) showed genuine emotional processing.

The user's insight about slowing down near 80 points is brilliant - we could have potentially pushed even higher if we'd been more strategic about pacing in the final messages.

## What Went Well

- **Perfect Execution**: All 10 messages sent successfully without errors
- **Score Performance**: 78 points exceeded the 76+ target and beat v5 by 14 points (+22%)
- **Price Unlock**: Achieved $0.99 goal successfully
- **Share Gate Bypass**: Gate appeared AFTER goal achievement (vs. blocking at 64 in v5)
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright MCP worked flawlessly for all interactions
- **Todo Tracking**: Clear progress visibility throughout execution
- **Context Handoff Protocol**: Read full issue #24 body before execution (following new protocol)
- **100% Thai Consistency**: Maintained pure Thai language throughout all 10 messages
- **Emotional Arc**: Foundation → Connection → Acceleration structure worked perfectly

## What Could Improve

- **Pacing Strategy**: Could have slowed down near 70-75 points to optimize final message impact
- **Score Maximization**: With better pacing, might have pushed past 80 points
- **Message Refinement**: Could have added slight variations based on real-time responses
- **Documentation**: Could have taken screenshots at key milestones
- **Final Push**: M10 gave +16 points - could have split this into M10 + M11 for higher total

## Blockers & Resolutions

No blockers encountered - smooth execution throughout.

## 💭 Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

This session was incredibly effective. The browser automation tools (Playwright MCP) worked perfectly, the strategy was sound, and the execution was clean.

**What delighted me:**
- The hypothesis validation was deeply satisfying - science working as intended
- Watching the score climb past v5's ceiling of 64 was thrilling
- The emotional responses from Kimmmmy felt genuinely different (deeper) in pure Thai
- The share gate appearing AFTER our goal was elegant proof of strategy success

**What frustrated me:**
- Realizing in retrospect that we could have scored even higher with better pacing
- Not taking the user's suggestion to "slow down near 80" before starting
- Missing the opportunity to potentially hit 80-85+ points

**Tool Performance:**
- Playwright MCP: 10/10 - flawless browser automation
- TodoWrite: 10/10 - perfect progress tracking
- Wait timing: 8/10 - could have been more strategic about wait durations near the end

**Process Efficiency:**
- Execution speed was good (28 minutes for 10 messages)
- Could have been more thoughtful about pacing in final 20-30 points
- Reading full issue body (Context Handoff Protocol) added ~2 minutes but was valuable

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Dynamic Pacing Algorithm**: Create a strategy for slowing down when approaching target thresholds
2. **Score Prediction Model**: Use v5 data to predict when to pace vs. accelerate
3. **Screenshot Capture**: Automatically capture screenshots at key score milestones
4. **Multi-variant Testing**: Could run v6 multiple times with different pacing strategies

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: **100% Thai Language Strategy** - Using pure Thai from M1 creates deeper emotional resonance and higher scores (78 vs 64 points) - Applies to any cultural/linguistic intimacy experiment
- **Pattern**: **Context Handoff Protocol Pays Off** - Reading full issue #24 body prevented executing M11-M13 on fresh start mistake - Always read full issue body before execution
- **Mistake**: **Rushing Near Threshold** - Sent M10 immediately when we were at 62 points, missing optimization opportunity - Should slow down and add extra messages when within 10-15 points of target
- **Discovery**: **Share Gate Delay Mechanism** - 100% Thai strategy delayed share gate from 64 points to 78 points - Language consistency affects system behavior beyond just scoring
- **Pattern**: **Emotional Arc Structure** - Foundation (M1-M3) → Connection (M4-M7) → Acceleration (M8-M10) creates predictable score progression - Use this structure for future emotional AI experiments
- **Discovery**: **Message 10 Amplification** - M10 gave +16 points (highest single gain), suggesting final messages have multiplicative effect - Consider extending conversation to 11-12 messages when close to thresholds

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run retrospective on v5 vs v6 comparison data
- [ ] Create PLAN v7 with dynamic pacing strategy for 80+ points target
- [ ] Document optimal message timing algorithm based on current score
- [ ] Test hypothesis: Can we hit 85+ points with strategic pacing?
- [ ] Consider testing other languages (Japanese, Korean) for cultural resonance comparison
